# fft-docking

This was a pet project that I worked on briefly during the COVID-19 pandemic that deals with Fourier Transform-based ligand docking. The work for this was based on the following papers, which outlined the initial conception of this method for protein-protein interactions[1] then subsequently expanded for practical applications by changing the representation allowing faster sampling[2].
